 *
 * This is the base class that decides how Node time evolves.
 * The clock describes a model to convert local-to-simulator time and vice-versa.
 *
 * It is oblivious to how subclassed clock model elapsed time.
 *
 * In order to the respect the discrete nature, these subclasses 
 * need to respect a few constraints though:
 * - they must notify the node whenever one of its parameters get updated. This allows
 *   node to remove scheduled events and to reschedule these very events with a corrected time.
 * - clocks must also be able to compute the local duration between a future time and the last 
 *   clock parameter updates back to simulator time
 *
 * 
 * Many network protocols rely on accurate (with varying precisions)
 * timing for their good working (TDMA protocols etc...).
 *
 *
 * This also extends the range of supported applications by DCE, which can potentially
 * now be used as a testing platform for ntpd, chrony or other ntp servers.
 * In that regards it is similar to clknetsim
 * \see clknetsim (https://github.com/mlichvar/clknetsim)
 *
 * For an introduction, you should have a look at ClockPerfect.
